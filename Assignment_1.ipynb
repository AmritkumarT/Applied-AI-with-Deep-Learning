Afterwards, you train your model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set. To finish this exercise, you will past the accuracy of your model to the Coursera grader.\n\nThis notebook is tested in IBM Watson Studio under python 3.6\n\n##\u00a0Data\n\nFor this exercise we will use the Reuters newswire dataset. This dataset consists of 11,228 newswires from the Reuters news agency. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes, just as in the IMDB data we encountered in lecture 5 of this series. Moreover, each wire is categorised into one of 46 topics, which will serve as our label. This dataset is available through the Keras API.\n\n## Goal\n\nWe want to create a Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Keras which we can train to classify news items into the specified 46 topics.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWe start by installing and importing everything we need for this exercise:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "!pip install tensorflow==2.2.0rc0", "execution_count": 2, "outputs": [{"output_type": "stream", "text": "Requirement already satisfied: tensorflow==2.2.0rc0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (2.2.0rc0)\nRequirement already satisfied: protobuf>=3.8.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==2.2.0rc0) (3.12.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: astunparse==1.6.3 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==2.2.0rc0) (1.6.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: keras-preprocessing>=1.1.0 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==2.2.0rc0) (1.1.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: wrapt>=1.11.1 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==2.2.0rc0) (1.11.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: google-pasta>=0.1.8 in /opt/conda/envs/Python36/lib/python3.6/site-packages (from tensorflow==2.2.0rc0) (0.2.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: wheel>=0.26;
