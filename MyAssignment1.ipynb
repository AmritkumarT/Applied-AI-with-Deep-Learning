Afterwards, you train your model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set. To finish this exercise, you will past the accuracy of your model to the Coursera grader.\n\nThis notebook is tested in IBM Watson Studio under python 3.6\n\n##\u00a0Data\n\nFor this exercise we will use the Reuters newswire dataset. This dataset consists of 11,228 newswires from the Reuters news agency. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes, just as in the IMDB data we encountered in lecture 5 of this series. Moreover, each wire is categorised into one of 46 topics, which will serve as our label. This dataset is available through the Keras API.\n\n## Goal\n\nWe want to create a Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Keras which we can train to classify news items into the specified 46 topics.\n\n## Instructions\n\nWe start by installing and importing everything we need for this exercise:"}, {"metadata": {"scrolled": true}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "!pip install tensorflow==2.2.0rc0", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "import tensorflow as tf\nif not tf.__version__ == '2.2.0-rc0':\n    print(tf.__version__)\n    raise ValueError('please upgrade to TensorFlow 2.2.0-rc0, or restart your Kernel (Kernel->Restart & Clear Output)')", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "IMPORTANT! => Please restart the kernel by clicking on \"Kernel\"->\"Restart and Clear Outout\" and wait until all output disapears.

For this we use a *Tokenizer* from Keras' text preprocessing module. This tokenizer will take an index sequence and map it to a vector of length *max_words=1000*. Each of the 1000 vector positions corresponds to one of the words in our newswire corpus. The output of the tokenizer has a 1 at the i-th position of the vector, if the word corresponding to i is in the description of the newswire, and 0 otherwise.
